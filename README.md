# AI Confusion Matrix Assignment

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for the AI course, demonstrating the **confusion matrix** concept.  
A dataset was used to train a classifier, and predictions were compared with actual labels.

## Files Included
- **`wine_confusion_matrix.ipynb`** – Colab notebook with:
  - Dataset loading and preprocessing
  - Model training
  - Predictions (`Actual` vs `Predicted`)
  - Confusion matrix visualization
- **`wine_unique_predictions.csv`** – CSV file containing test data with `Actual` and `Predicted` labels

## Dataset
- Based on the **Wine dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
- Classes renamed to: `WineA`, `WineB`, `WineC` 
- Features include 13 chemical properties of wine

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Run all cells from top to bottom.
3. The notebook will generate:
   - Confusion matrix visualization
   - Classification report
   - CSV file of actual vs predicted labels
